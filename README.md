- Automatic merging of adjacent tiles with the same value
- Real-time score tracking and best score memory
- Console-based UI for a minimal and interactive experience
- Modular and maintainable C++ code using classes and STL

## Technologies
- Language: C++
- Concepts: OOP (encapsulation, abstraction), STL (vector, set), basic I/O
